* The rules of Chicago are straightforward. A good comparison to Chicago would be the game Rummy 500. 

* Generally, a game of Chicago can take anywhere from forty-five minutes to an hour and twenty minutes. 

* The overall objective of the game is to go out each round and maintain the lowest score possible. 

* The game consists of two decks of cards, jokers included, for a total of 108 cards. 

* You have runs, which are where any four or more cards in a row that share the same color and suit. 

  * For example, a 2, 3, 4, 5 of spades in red is considered a run. 

* Next, there are sets, which are any three or more cards that are the same rank, but they can be any color. 

  * For example, a 3, 3, 3 of spades and hearts in red and black. 

* There are 6 rounds of Chicago, where the first round is two sets, the second round is two runs, the third round is two sets and a run, 
  * the fourth round is two runs and a set, the fifth round is three sets, and the final and sixth round is three runs. 

* A round consists of three, four, or five players with eleven cards, the first person picks up a card, and if they meet the requirements 
  * for putting down for that specific round they can do so, otherwise you have to discard a card. During a round, everyone has the option to “May I”. 
  
* That means that if someone who is not up wants the card that was discarded, everyone has to agree to it and if so that person gets the 
  * card and a card from the shuffled deck, you can only have three “May I’s” a round. 

* During the last round, you have to “May I” at least once to meet the minimum requirement of cards needed to be put down, which is twelve cards. 

* The scoring system of Chicago is very simple. 

  * When someone goes out at the end of the round, everyone else has to count the number of cards in your hand. 

  * A 2 through 9 is five points, a 10, Jack, Queen, and King is ten points, an Ace is fifteen points, and a Joker is fifty points. 

  * A Joker is considered a blank card, where it can be anything the player decides it to be, but if put down with a 
   * set that Joker is considered dead and cannot be used anywhere else for the remainder of that round.
